My solutions to [SPOJ] problems. If possible, I will try to add more solutions in the future.
Almost all of them in Java, but you can find solutions in Python, C ++ or C. Hey, check out my profile at SPOJ [here]. :)

## About SPOJ

The SPOJ platform is centered around an online judge system, which serves for the automatic assessment of user-submitted programs. Some of its most important features include:

- Support for more than 45 programming languages and compilers, including C, C++, Pascal, JAVA, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby, Haskell, Ocaml, and esoteric languages.

- A rapidly growing problem-set of about 13000 tasks available for practice 24hours/day (in English, Polish, Vietnamese, Portuguese and other languages), including many original tasks prepared by the community of expert problemsetters associated with the project.

- A flexible testing system, supporting dynamic interaction with submitted programs and highly customisable output of assessment results.

- Intuitive browser-based content management which allows users to set up their own contests within a matter of minutes, and to make use of tasks already available in the system.

more than 2400 contests hosted as of 2012, ranging from instant challenges to long-term e-learning courses.

The SPOJ is available under the [MIT] license.
